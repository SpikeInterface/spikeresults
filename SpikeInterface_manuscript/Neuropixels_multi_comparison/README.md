# Comparison of spike sorters on Neuropixels recording with SpikeInterface

The `neuropixels-multi-comparison.ipynb` notebook reproduces the plots in Figure 3 of the [SpikeInterface paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/796599v1).

Dataset acquired by Andre Marques-Smith et al.<sup>1,2</sup>, downloadable from [crcns.org](http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K0J67F4T).

In this example we analyze the recording `c1` using several spike sorters and extract their consensus.
You can download the `c1.ta.gz`, unpack it, and place it in this folder.

The `main_script.py` does all the loading, preprocessing, spike sorting, comparison, and plotting.
