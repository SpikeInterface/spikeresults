# Comparison of spike sorters with mearec and spiketoolkit

@author : Samuel Garcia


Alessio Paolo Buccino author of [MEArec](https://github.com/alejoe91/MEArec) have generated a dataset with ground truth.

The simulated probe is **SqMEA-10-15**.

It is a very dense probe. The duration is 60s.

The file **recordings_50cells_SqMEA-10-15um_60.0_10.0uV_27-03-2019_13_31.h5** is (will be) freely downloadable to reproduce results.

This notebook is is demonstration of the spiketoolkit ground truth comparison framework.
It launch several popular sorter on this recording and compute some performence metrics.
